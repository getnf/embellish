# Note

This app has been ported from Go to Gjs, and only the GUI is left, the ClI/TUI was removed, reasons for this are.

- [getnf](https://github.com/getnf/getnf.git) is a very mature and like CLI/TUI that achieved the same goals as the go version with smaller bundle size and simpler design
- It was getting hard to add new features as the projec was getting quit big and there aren't many resources to learning GTK development with go
- I was not enjoying writing go.

I hope you like this new ported verison, as it is more polished and nicer looking with some new featues.
Please check getnf for a CLI/TUI version.
